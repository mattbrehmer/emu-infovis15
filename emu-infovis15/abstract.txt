The energy performance of large building portfolios is challenging to analyze and monitor, as current analysis tools are not scalable, or they present derived and aggregated data that is too coarse. We conducted a visualization design study, beginning with a thorough work domain analysis and a characterization of data and task abstractions. We describe generalizable visual encoding design choices for time-oriented data framed in terms of matches and mismatches, as well as considerations for workflow design. Our designs address several research questions pertaining to scalability, view coordination, and the inappropriateness of line charts for derived and aggregated data. We also present guidelines relating to familiarity and trust, as well as methodological considerations for visualization design studies. Our designs were adopted by our collaborator and incorporated into the design of an energy analysis software application that will be deployed to a user base of tens of thousands of energy workers.
